# vtt2srt in Go

Just a simple program to convert WebVTT subtitles to SRT subtitles.
I just implemented it to start learning Go. So don't expect it to be anything
special or complete.

The test.vtt file is from <https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/#introduction-caption>

## Installation

To download / update and compile the source code:

`go get -u github.com/john2ksonn/vtt2srt`

To just download the source code:

`go get -d github.com/john2ksonn/vtt2srt`
